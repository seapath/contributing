## Code of Conduct

This project applies the [LF Energy Code of Conduct](https://www.lfenergy.org/about/code-of-conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project's Technical Steering Committee [SEAPATH-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org](mailto:SEAPATH-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org).

## License and Developer Certificate of Origin

By contributing to the SEAPATH project, you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future contributions submitted to SEAPATH.

All contributions to this project are licensed under the license stipulated at the corresponding sub-repository. Except where otherwise explicitely indicated, SEAPATH is an open source project licensed under the [Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0/). 

The project requires the use of the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). The DCO is a legally binding statement asserting that you are you have the right to submit your contribution and to license it under the project's applicable license.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to the term of the DCO by adding a ``Signed-off-by`` line to commit messages. The DCO sign-off must be attached to every contribution made by every contributor.

Here is an example ``Signed-off-by`` line, that indicates the contributor accepts the DCO:

````
This is my commit message.

Signed-off-by: Name Surname <name.surname@entity.com>
````
You can write it manually but Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:
````
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
````

Note that checks will be performed during the integration in order to require that commits in a Pull Request contain valid ``Signed-off-by`` lines.

## Project Governance

#### Project Owner

SEAPATH is part of the [LF Energy Foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org/), a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects within the energy and electricity sectors.

#### Technical Charter

The Project's [Technical Charter](SEAPATH%20Technical%20Charter%20x-x-2020.pdf) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the SEAPATH Project.

#### Committers

Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project owner.

#### Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is composed of voting members elected by the active Committers as described in the projectâ€™s Technical Charter. The TSC is responsible for the technical direction of the project.

#### Members
SEAPATH TSC voting members are:
- Christian Guibout
- Aurelien Watare (https://github.com/watare)

#### Voting
While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. The simple majority is needed to approve proposals.
The preferred way to vote is to create a poll [here](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/SEAPATH-tsc/addpoll).

#### Responsibilities
The project is split into several repositories. There is at least one Committer in charge of each repository. By "in charge", we mean:
-	best effort to review the pull request,
-	best effort to resolve issues,
-	building and publishing the releases, including writing the release notes and informing the community,
-	in case of unability to perform the above tasks, the Committer in charge has to ask the TSC through the list [SEAPATH-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org](mailto:SEAPATH-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org) to find another Committer to review the pull request, resolve the issue or build and publish the release.  

Please refer to our [maintainers file](MAINTAINERS.md) for more details about our work division.

#### Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
